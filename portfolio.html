  <h1>Selected Projects</h1>
    <p>Here are some of the exciting projects I've been working on, blending education, technology, and creativity to make learning musical instruments more fun and engaging.</p>

    <p><strong>MEI-Trumpet</strong> is an educational web application developed to help music students learn proper fingering and sound production techniques on trumpet. <a href="https://mei-trumpet.web.app/" target="_blank"><strong>Click HERE to try MEI-Trumpet now!</strong></a></p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>The app provides customizable exercises where users can specify the metronome value and the desired note range:</p>

    <div class="input-image">
      <img src="assets/input.jpg" alt="Input Parameters for Tempo and Note Range" 
           class="input-screenshot" onclick="toggleImageSize(this)">
    </div>

    <p>Each exercise is structured in three steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first measure is a rest, allowing the student to prepare</li>
      <li>The second measure plays a reference note, offering an example to imitate</li>
      <li>The third measure is for the user to play the note</li>
    </ul>

    <p>On the top of the screen, an image showing the correct trumpet fingering, including adjustments for the third valve slide, is displayed. This helps students easily associate the note shown on the musical staff with the corresponding pitch and valve combination.</p>

    <h2>Research Background</h2>
    <p>MEI-Trumpet is part of a research project led by Alberto Acquilino at the Schulich School of Music of McGill University, in collaboration with the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF). Ongoing studies aim to further define the pedagogical foundations of the interface and discuss its usability and social validity through groups of participants.</p>

    <p><strong>The source code for the app is publicly available <a href="https://github.com/albertoacquilino/music-education-interface-ionic/tree/gsoc-2024" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

    <p>MEI-Trumpet is available as a free beta version for both web and mobile devices:</p>

  <div class="app-store-links">

        <img src="assets/googleplay.png" alt="Get it on Google Play" class="app-badge">
    </a>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>Once users get the hang of playing the right note, scaffolding helps them take it to the next level! Adding a chromatic tuner and dynamic markings, users are encouraged to fine-tune their pitch and volume control bringing more expression and style to their playing.</p>
  <div class="app-screenshots">
    <img src="assets/screen_tuner.png" alt="Tuner Screenshot" class="tuner-screenshot" style="border: 3px solid #4CAF50; transition: border-color 0.5s ease-in-out, border-radius 10px; border-radius: 10px;" onmouseover="this.style.borderColor='#FF5733'" onmouseout="this.style.borderColor='#4CAF50'">
  </div>

  <p>To further refine the student's technique, a machine learning model was integrated into the learning interface to classify sounds based on their timbral quality. This functionality introduces a new layer of complexity, helping users develop their musical competencies.

  <h2>Ongoing Development</h2>
  <p>Future developments of this project focus on enhancing its capabilities through adaptive learning features. The Music Education Interface aims to integrate generative AI to provide a more personalized and inclusive learning experience. Key advancements include:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>üéØ <strong>Personalized exercises</strong> tailored to students‚Äô technical level, age, and progression speed.</li>
      <li>üìä <strong>AI-driven analysis of student performance</strong>, offering recommendations for refining learning activities.</li>
      <li>üí° <strong>A user-friendly, code-free interface</strong> enabling music educators to design and deploy customized exercises.</li>
      <li>üåç <strong>Enhanced inclusivity and accessibility</strong>, ensuring diverse learning experiences for students of all backgrounds and abilities.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The objective is to make music education more engaging, effective, and adaptable to individual needs.</p>
